I've been working in an archive in Leuven over the past few months. In between my classes I squeeze in a few hours of sorting through the stacks and doing whatever dirty work the archivists give me to pay for the inexcusable amount of expensive lattes I order in Leuven's coffee bars. My tasks include folding archive boxes, removing paperclips and other metal from stacks of paper, taking boxes from one rack and placing them in another rack, entering metadata in the archive catalog, and throwing out tons (literally tons) of paper that won't be archived. This last task is simply what archives do: they take what institutions give them, throw out about 95% percent of it, and carefully index and store the remaining 5% of 'useful' information. Ofcourse the archivists have standards and procedures they follow when selecting what goes in the archive and what gets dumped into the trash. Still, I wonder at what potential is lost in the things I throw out on a daily basis. Last week I have been tasked with sifting through the hundreds of magazines on film and multimedia that were deposited by a big institution collecting every magazine dealing with film throughout the world. I was to arrange these magazines by number and throw out any duplicates. Some of these magazines are magnificent: cute little bulletins from Thailand and the Philippines, huge commercial magazines reaching all the way back to their inception in the fourties and fifties, and niftily typed-out newszines made by a single person typing out fifty copies of their locally distributed film reviews. A lot of these magazines have cover art drawn by in-house artists and amazing comics commenting on local politics or film censuring. Couldn't these beautiful magazines, that sometimes look more like works of art than informational pieces, could be used for something better than paper pulp and biomass electricity generators? Artists, remixers and other content creators are constantly looking for old content to use and reuse. Remixing culture is thriving. Why are archives not capitalizing on this to open their unneeded, unwanted material to those who would love to access it? Archives generally don't realize that their trash could be someone else's inspiration. Artists generally don't realize that by looking at the trails of the past they can find content to revive and work with. Making archives more proactive by reaching out to teachers of art studies, by promoting their contents on social media, by coaxing remixers to reuse their content, value can be added to society and to the archive at the same time. This doesn't come without things to think about, ofcourse. Privacy of the contents of an institutions' archive is one. Copyright legislation is another. But these should not prevent archives from doing more than being the silent keeper of knowledge. Because keeping isn't sharing. And why would you keep information preserved if you don't have the goal of sharing it with others?
