## Facebook and the quest for Mars Colonization
<div style="text-align:justify;">

In our second class of Intro to DH we had a conversation about the past, present and future of technology. The main point our teacher made was that during most of the twentieth century, technology was used for meaningful innovation that furthered the development of humanity. She gave the examples of nuclear power and space travel. Today, she posited, innovation in technology is used for a completely different goal. Buzz Aldrin's Time magazine quote 'You promised me Mars colonies. Instead, I got Facebook' beamed down on us from the powerpoint presentation. There is this all-encompassing feeling that technology has stopped trying to solve humanities' Big Problems. Another quote, loosely attributed to 'the internet', says 'Born too late to explore the earth. Born too early to explore the galaxy. Born just in time to browse dank memes.'

It's impossible to try and ignore that this is a feeling a lot of people have. Our parents tell us of how they sat in front of the TV screen of the one person in their street that had a TV set to see the first man ever land on the moon on a live feed. I myself remember us gathering around our desktop PC to watch Steve Jobs unveil the new iPod and the first iPhone. We stopped watching the Apple live streams somewhere around the third generation of iPhones. This feeds into this atmosphere of the unimportance of technological innovation today. Here's a few remarks on this topic

First of all, the presentation of the first iPhone seems like a step down from watching a human walk the moon for the first time ever. Jason Pontin wrote 'Why we Can't solve Big problems', a blog post for the MIT Technology Review, in 2012 <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">* </a></sup>

Blithe optimism about technology’s powers has evaporated, too, as big problems that people had imagined technology would solve, such as hunger, poverty, malaria, climate change, cancer, and the diseases of old age, have come to seem intractably hard.
I remember sitting in my family’s living room in Berkeley, California, watching the liftoff of Apollo 17. I was five; my mother admonished me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of the Saturn 5 rocket. I vaguely knew that this was the last of the moon missions—but I was absolutely certain that there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime. What happened?

Is the iPhone an innovation on the same scale as a moon landing? Peter Thiel, cofounder of PayPal, doesn't see it as a technological breakthrough. He says that Silicon Valley and Venture Capitalism has eschewed risky investments with visionary goals to instead fund 'features, widgets, irrelevances'.
Pontin's article accepts that, aside from the personal-computer revolution, we once did big things but do so no longer. He then proceeds to try and explain why that is. I want to argue that
<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, there was a slump in technological innovation in the past few years, maybe even the past decade.
<br/>
- This doesn't mean that innovations like smartphone development and the expansion of social media isn't a huge feat of technology.
<br/>
- We are still doing big things, but they are being done in a different, complex way, and are manifold.
<br/>
<br/>
In 2012, I too would have chimed in with technological pessimists. Up until 2015 it seemed like the world of technology wasn't moving that much forward at all. The fact that the new iPhone had a different bezel was big news. Google Glass was announced, ridiculed, and sent to the scrap heap in almost less than a year. Windows 8 was released. Meh. But what about now, in 2016? Is there still this feeling of technological pessimism? I would want to argue that the tides are turning. The hype about big innovations in technology are back on. People are passionate about initiatives that aim to change the world. But it might not feel like that for everyone. Technological innovation isn't pushed forward by a single government or a bloc of states anymore. Instead, it's mostly private companies of different sizes that independently try to work towards the execution of a grand vision. I think that the turning point that pushed me back towards technolocial optimism and hype were the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4y0KOeXViI">#madebygoogle</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8">SpaceX</a> keynotes a few weeks ago. The Google keynote pointed towards the focus on voice activated technology as the next big step in human-computer interaction, and Elon Musk showed that private companies can and are working on the 'Big Projects' everyone seems to want so much. I warmly advise anyone who hasn't seen them to watch them if you have a few hours to spare. Once you also feel that we do live in a world where humanity is taking huge strides, you'll agree that the following list gives good examples of why we shouldn't berate the current technological development for not being innovative and far-seeing enough.
<br/>
<br/>
- VR is being released to the consumer market
<br/>
- self-driving cars are on the brink of being viable
<br/>
- electric cars have, for the first time, become a viable option for consumers
<br/>
- drones have changed the way we see the world, and has manifold applications
<br/>
- Private companies work on big visions. Google still wants to collect all of the world's information and make it accessible to everyone. Elon Musk is spearheading the automobile revolution, is bringing sustainable power to everyone's homes, and is planning on sending the first people to mars in 2025.
<br/>
- 3D printing has become a consumer-grade article that offers a plethora of possibilities for, for instance, the republic of makers.
<br/>
- voice-activated communication has come to a point that it is legitimately changing the way we interact with technology and the world around us
<br/>
- e-readers have reached a standard where it could eclipse the printed book in publications and readership this year.
