## Not the Onion.
<div style="text-align:justify;">
A great subreddit is /r/nottheonion. It's a collection of news stories that could well have been created by the satirical news outlet the Onion, but are in fact completely true news stories. The Onion prides itself in coming across as a serious quality news outlet, mimicking CNN's signature style, with typical white male anchors and their sensual white female sidekicks bringing breaking news like 'human spontaneous combustion statistics skyrocket as rumour spreads that sneezing with your eyes open is possible.' The 'Not the Onion' subreddit is at times just as hilarious, but at other times flat out scary. 'Trump win election' was the top story on /r/nottheonion a few weeks ago. We are, indeed, in the specific parallel universe where all circumstances and choices ever lead to Donald Trump being elected president of the United States.

As outrage spread and people sought to find answers, fingers were pointed at social media. 'Fake News has rigged the elections in favor of Donald Trump', they said. 'Zuckerberg has influenced the elections by skewing news feeds towards republican voters and letting fake news spread freely on the platform.' As pointed out succinctly in class by my fellow students, of course this wasn't Mark Zuckerberg's evil plan. Allowing Fake News to be posited as True News on facebook is a problem created by a lack of protocol and guidelines. Why weren't these in place before the election, you might think? On the one hand, it would be silly to ban all satirical news stories on social media. The other side of the argument would then be that it should be impossible for satirical news to be stated as actual news. That is a valid point. But it dismisses the problem of definition. What is Fake news, and what is True news? This conundrum can be turned into a day-long discussion. It's simply important to realize that there are fine and fluid boundaries between what is fact and what is fiction. Within discourse, anything can be stated as fact.

## Sexual Configurations theory
<div style="text-align:justify;">

After reading the first few pages of this article, I realized I was wrong about the topic. This wander about visualizing gender identity at all, it was about visualizing sexual orientation! Of course these two are connected in some way, ander Sexual Configurations Theory aims to integrate views of gender/sex into sexual orientation to map Sexuality more complexly, intersectionally, correctly. In general, it looks to create a new model to solve the problems associated with 'traditional' sexuality mappings. The most well-known of these mappings is probably the Kinsey Scale.

With a bit of logical though the problems with this scale become readily apparent. Van Anders, the author of the paper, succinctly points out a lot of these problems. To name a few: <br/>
<br/>
- It doesn't account for the fluidity of sexual orientation: you don't always feel attracted to the same people all the time. The Kinsey number is a static, unchanging one
<br/>
- The gender/sex types in the Kinsey Scale are binary. People that don't fit into the binary gender/sex roles or are not attracted to solely binary gender/sex roles are not included.
<br/>
<br/>
These aren't the only problems with the Kinsey scale, and other vizualisations of sexual orientation for that matter. I would refer you to Van Anders' paper if you want to read more on this topic. My Intro to DH paper will be an analysis of Van Anders' work and the discussion surrounding Sexual Configurations Theory (SCT). It will also try to look at the possibilities of creating a rendered and interactive vizualisation of the SCT theory. In Van Anders' paper, it looks a bit like this:

Wouldn't it be great if this was a 3D model that allowed you to place yourself as a point somewhere? It could be a great way of defining your own complexity in a succinct way. It could also help you understand how your sexual orientation relates to others. It could provide context. Even if doing this is meaningless, thinking about a way of changing a static 2D image of a 3D shape into an interactive 3D model is a nice exercise in applying digital tools to humanities research. This could be a step towards getting rid of the dreaded 'two checkboxes' that so permeates our bureaucratic society and marginalizes those who do not fit into binary gender stereotypes. If models like these can be made interactive, why not implement a similar model of defining your gender/sex into the forms we all have to fill in at several points in our lives?
