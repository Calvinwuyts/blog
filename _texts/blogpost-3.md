## Missing class
<div style="text-align:justify;">
Our fifth class on Digital Humanities was on the 31st of November. Halloween. I wasn't in Leuven that day. I woke up to the sound of a duck tramping on the roof of our cute canary yellow camping wagon that we had hired for two nights. Our wagonette stood in a grassy meadow next to one of the lakes created by the Amsterdam dams keeping the Ij at bay from inundating the city. I wouldn't be able to attend the class I would have wanted to attend the most this semester, the one on gender and diversity. On top of that, our teacher would most probably be in Halloween costume. Afterwards I heard she had indeed not shied away of dressing up before class. Sadly, no one else had bothered. But who am I to judge, I hadn't even bothered to show up. I was still sleepy from the night before, where we had thanked Lil Dicky's roadies profusely for giving us free tickets to his Dick or Treat tour. It had been a great night.

I reminded Nic to send me the link to that paper he had mentioned once, something about a theory for visualizing gender identity. "Oh yeah, the Sexual Configurations Theory one". Uhh yeah, that one I guess.

## Sexual Configurations theory
<div style="text-align:justify;">

After reading the first few pages of this article, I realized I was wrong about the topic. This wander about visualizing gender identity at all, it was about visualizing sexual orientation! Of course these two are connected in some way, ander Sexual Configurations Theory aims to integrate views of gender/sex into sexual orientation to map Sexuality more complexly, intersectionally, correctly. In general, it looks to create a new model to solve the problems associated with 'traditional' sexuality mappings. The most well-known of these mappings is probably the Kinsey Scale.

With a bit of logical though the problems with this scale become readily apparent. Van Anders, the author of the paper, succinctly points out a lot of these problems. To name a few: <br/>
<br/>
- It doesn't account for the fluidity of sexual orientation: you don't always feel attracted to the same people all the time. The Kinsey number is a static, unchanging one
<br/>
- The gender/sex types in the Kinsey Scale are binary. People that don't fit into the binary gender/sex roles or are not attracted to solely binary gender/sex roles are not included.
<br/>
<br/>
These aren't the only problems with the Kinsey scale, and other vizualisations of sexual orientation for that matter. I would refer you to Van Anders' paper if you want to read more on this topic. My Intro to DH paper will be an analysis of Van Anders' work and the discussion surrounding Sexual Configurations Theory (SCT). It will also try to look at the possibilities of creating a rendered and interactive vizualisation of the SCT theory. In Van Anders' paper, it looks a bit like this:

Wouldn't it be great if this was a 3D model that allowed you to place yourself as a point somewhere? It could be a great way of defining your own complexity in a succinct way. It could also help you understand how your sexual orientation relates to others. It could provide context. Even if doing this is meaningless, thinking about a way of changing a static 2D image of a 3D shape into an interactive 3D model is a nice exercise in applying digital tools to humanities research. This could be a step towards getting rid of the dreaded 'two checkboxes' that so permeates our bureaucratic society and marginalizes those who do not fit into binary gender stereotypes. If models like these can be made interactive, why not implement a similar model of defining your gender/sex into the forms we all have to fill in at several points in our lives?
