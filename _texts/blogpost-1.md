## Why do we keep dilly-dallying?
<div style="text-align:justify;">
From the moment you start to look up papers on Digital Humanities, you quickly come across a vast corpus of texts devoted to the simple question: "What on earth IS Digital Humanities?". At first glance, it might seem that the digital humanities are a very new phenomenon and that these papers trying to define DH are just the symptoms of growth pain of a newly emerging field of study. A few hours after this first observation, you will slowly start to realize that this simply cannot be the case. Depending on where you locate the starting point, digital humanities may already exist for ten, twenty, fifty years or even longer. There are organizations around the globe dedicated to DH, like ADHO and the EADH. It has its own journals, its own canon of texts, its own manifestos, its own conferences. How can this vivid and thriving field not even know how to define itself? Granted, for a new academic discipline fifty years is a very small timeframe. It took other academic disciplines (like psychology) much longer to become recognized and institutionalized. But it seems like DH does have an extraordinarily hard time defining itself. How come? Shouldn't that be easy? Psychology etymologically comes from the Greek psykhe (the soul, the breath) and logia (the study of). It is the study of the mind. the Humanities is derived from the singular word 'humanity', which from the late 15th century was used to designate the 'class of studies concerned with human culture.'<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">\*</a></sup>  Is it then not too far of a stretch to simply define digital humanities as 'the class of studies concerned with digital human culture'?

## It's not that simple.
<div style="text-align:justify;">
In a broad sense, I think this definition encompasses a lot of what generally is thought of being digital humanities. the use of the words 'human culture' makes the definition broader than a simple referral to the humanities fields (history, art history, philosophy, language and linguistics, religion). It includes all types of media, since media in itself is inherently cultural. It includes fields sometimes set apart from the humanities like sociology, politics, even geography. When we turn to the 'digital' part of the definition, it gets trickier. The definition 'studies concerned with digital human culture' makes it seem that digital humanities only studies the parts of human culture that reside in the digital sphere. This is certainly a constituting part of DH, but in reality DH is much broader than the study of digital culture. Most digital humanities research is oriented towards the use of digital tools and methods for studying the 'regular' humanities. These new methods and tools open a whole new plethora of possible research questions, projects, etc. Humanities research has so much potential for answers about the human society that can be tapped into with the possibilities given to us in the information age. It is a veritable torrent of change: digital tools and methods create new possibilities for answers, but they also raise more research questions; they create a need for digitization, processing, dissemination; they make it necessary to think about how to treat, study, and store digital information for the present and the future; they require tool criticism; and so on, and so forth. All of this is part of digital humanities. Why? Because people who deal with any of these issues and label themselves as digital humanists <b>make</b> it a part of digital humanities. So is the simple sentence 'class of studies concerned with digital human culture' not good enough then? I don't think so. DH is much broader than the study of digital human culture. It is also not only a class of study. From the start of this blog on I've pretended DH was an emerging scientific discipline, a new academic field. But is that what it is? Some people surely think so. King's College London recently opened their own Digital Humanities department. Others define it completely differently. I want to talk about DH as a community.

## DH isn't just a department.
<div style="text-align:justify;">
The Digital Humanities manifesto 2.0. doesn't really define Digital Humanities in one or a few sentences. That isn't what digital humanities is about, according to the manifesto. And its right. The focus on iteration and fluidity makes it impossible to define DH simply and definitively. But the manifesto does add a few attributes to what DH is: according to the manifesto, DH is 'an array of convergent practices'. I really like that sentence. it homes in on the active role digital humanists pride themselves on taking. the word 'practices' hints to the importance of the <b>making</b> process of digital humanities. It also detaches digital humanities of the realm of departments: a department centers around a subject it studies. An array of practices focuses more on methodology and process than a predefined set of research subjects. The manifesto talks of 'Process as the new God'. It succeeds in putting into bold, daring words what a lot of digital humanists try to say when talking about defining DH.The manifesto tries to bring down the barriers between the 'manual realm of making and the mental realm of thinking'. This, for me, lies at the heart of what needs to be done to define DH. In my eyes, a well-rounded short definition of DH should reflect the convergence of both of these concepts. It needs to capture the mental overhaul of traditional structures on the one hand and the focus on iteration, collaboration, breaking down of boundaries (like the boundaries of departments), and co-creation. This is very similar to what Gerben Zaagsma said in his article 'on digital humanities': the definition of DH in the manifesto

<br/>

<br/>

<i>'1) It bypasses the question of whether dh could or should be considered a field or discipline; instead, by focusing on practices it posits dh as integral to all humanities disciplines; 2) It does not separate digital history (or any other humanities sub-discipline) from digital humanities but acknowledges common methodological challenges and epistemological changes'</i>

<br/>

<br/>
I totally agree with him on those two points. What he continues on saying after that I wholeheartedly disagree with:

<br/>

<br/>

<i>'More specifcally, focusing on practices points to the transitional dimension of the use of the phrase digital humanities or digital history. I would argue that there is no such thing as ‘digital history’ as separate from ‘history’ and I would hope that within a decade or so there will be no more talk of ‘digital history’ as all history is somehow ‘digital’ in terms of incorporation of new types of sources, methods and ways of dissemination (just as all humanities will be inherently ‘digital’). Nevertheless digital history is a transitional term that exists for a reason: it has helped to emphasise and put into focus new practices, whether in terms of analysis or knowledge (re)presentation or both; and it highlights how data and tools are changing historical knowledge production.''</i>

<br/>

<br/>

So, three key concepts need to be included in a definition of DH: the concept of <b>making</b> through the use of the word 'practices', and the concept of <b>a revolution in thought</b> and <b>convergence</b>. Let's deal with how we should incorporate those last two.
</div>


## Digital Humanities as Utopian thinking
<div style="text-align:justify;">
A bit further down in the manifesto there is talk of a <b>utopian core</b> of digital humanities. I also really love that statement. It admit to a certain kind of naiveté that I find very important in conceptualizing goals. In my opinion one needs to be rash, radical, in creating a vision. That's why I also love Google's mission statement to become the next Library of Alexandria or Oracle of Delphi (as the DH manifesto puts it). How can one ever achieve a tremendous goal without first admitting to having tremendous goals? This utopia of infinite information access encompasses the revolution in thinking that DH tries to make happen so beautifully. That's why I would alter the definition of DH from 'an array of practices' to <b>'a community focused on an array of practices to approximate its utopian core.'</b> Yes, it's a very ethereal, hippie, floating-signifier kind of definition to have. But that's what I like about it. Lastly, I want to focus on this notion of community. Seeing DH as a 'community of people who self-define as Digital Humanists' is also very semantically relative and maybe says nothing at all. But that's also what I like about it, goddamn it.
</div>

## DH for convergence and diversity
<div style="text-align:justify;">
The utopian core of Digital Humanities doesn't only envision a world with universal storage and access to all information. For me, at least, it also entails the possibility of total equity, diversity, unification, and mutual respect. Theories behind super-diversity and intersectionality can become reality with by using the digital sphere to change our society. One of the utopian dreams is that of equal access to all information by every human, and equal rights to the re-use and input of information.
In my opinion we can approach this goal by setting the right example. The first effort needs to be in making Digital Humanities infrastructure and power structures the way we want the infrastructure and power structures of society to be. The manifesto uses this phrase to describe Wikinomics, but to me it describes the way to shape the DH community: <b>'a reconfiguration of the hierarchical relationship between masters and disciples.'</b> To that I would add <b>', between hegemons and minorities.'</b> The conference on intersectionality showed that there is still a long way to go in achieving, or at least getting closer to, this goal. 'Traditional Humanities is balkanized by nation, language, method, and media. Digital Humanities is about <b>convergence</b>' The traditional hegemonic power structures are still present in DH. By breaking those down in our own courtyard first, we can show how a model of convergence would look like. I strongly believe that Digital Humanities can change the way in which we see and treat each other. The digital sphere creates a possibility of closing the gap of access and distribution of information between the wealthy and the poor, and between the Global North and Global South. It creates the possibility of giving everyone, regardless of privilege, an equal voice. I don't say that is what the digital revolution is doing. Because it isn't. The <b>possibility</b> is there. Digital humanists can help change that possibility into reality. But we have to start with shaping Digital Humanities, before we try and shape the world. That's why, for me, a digital humanist is anyone who self-identifies as a digital humanist. It's an inclusive definition.
<br/>
<br/>
To conclude, here's my definition:
'Digital Humanities is, to Jolan Wuyts, a community of people that call themselves digital humanists, focused on an array of practices to approximate its utopian core. These goals include, but are not limited to: the use of digital tools and methods to change and enhance scholarly research, the creation of a universal library, and a move towards inclusiveness and diversity via convergence.'
